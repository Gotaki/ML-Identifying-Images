This project is based on the idea of gaining wider knowledge about data, neural networks and skills relevant to the field of AI. This project is a six-week project where the objective is to build a neural network using the TensorFlow library and the programming language Python, TensorFlow is a library that is used for machine learning. It is used to train and develop neural networks from various data sets. I plan to use this library to build a neural network to identify objects in images, classify text data, or perform other machine-learning tasks. That part has not been decided yet as I do not know the intensity of how hard each of these would be. However, a starting point I will be using is using my neural network to identify red buses in an image file. LinkedIn Learning, Youtube and various online resources would be vital in the first week of this project. The final learning objective of this project is to help me learn how to build and work with neural networks and ultimately gain valuable skills in the AI field.
